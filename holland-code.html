        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          The Holland Occupational Themes is a theory of personality that
          focuses on career and vocational choice. It groups people on the basis
          of their suitability for six different categories of occupations. The
          six types yield the RIASEC acronym, by which the theory is also
          commonly known. The theory was developed by John L. Holland over the
          course of his career, starting in the 1950s. The typology has come to
          dominate the field of career counseling and has been incorporated into
          most of the popular assessments used in the field. The RIASEC Markers
          from the Interest Item Pool were developed by Liao, Armstrong and
          Rounds (2008) for use in psychological research as a public domain
          alternative to the usual assessments which are marketed commercially.
